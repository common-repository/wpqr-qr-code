QR-Code widget and shortcode in one QR-Code generator plugin. Use the QR-Code widget in your sidebars or generate QR-Codes in pages and articles by inserting **[qr-code]** right where you want your QR-Code to be displayed.

The QR Code widget is equipped with configurations for alignment, color (foreground and background), size, margin, error correction of QR-Code and more to suit the needs of your installment. 

The shortcode [qr-code] can be extendet with attributes to achieve the same level of customization as with the widget.

[qr-code align="left" class="my-qr-code" color="#000000" background_color="#FFFFFF" size="4" margin="4" level="M" post_id="0"]
